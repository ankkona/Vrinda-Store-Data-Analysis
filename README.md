# ✅ Key Insights
1️⃣ Sales & Order Trend

- Sales and order volume peak during February and March, indicating strong early-year demand.

- A gradual decline is observed from April onwards, with the lowest sales recorded toward the end of the year.

- This suggests seasonality, where promotional campaigns early in the year perform better.

2️⃣ Gender-wise Sales Contribution

- Women dominate purchases, contributing approximately 64% of total sales.

- Men account for only 36%, highlighting women as the primary customer base.

- Marketing efforts should therefore be female-centric.

- Only a small fraction is cancelled, returned, or refunded (~8%), reflecting efficient logistics and customer satisfaction.

4️⃣ Top Performing States

- Maharashtra leads sales by a significant margin.

- Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh follow as the second and third highest contributors.

- These states represent the core revenue-generating regions and should be prioritized for regional campaigns.

5️⃣ Age & Gender Purchase Behavior

- The Adult age group (30–49 years) contributes the highest share of orders.

- Within every age group (Adult, Senior, Teenager), women consistently place more orders than men.

- Adult women alone account for over 34% of total orders, making them the most valuable segment.

6️⃣ Sales Channel Performance

- Amazon (35.5%) is the top-performing sales channel.
  
- Myntra (23.4%) and Flipkart (21.6%) together contribute nearly half of total orders.
  
- Platforms like Meesho, Ajio, Nalli, and others contribute marginally, indicating scope for optimization.
